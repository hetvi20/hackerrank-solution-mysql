###** {Weather Observation Station 18} ((https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-18/problem)


-- Consider p1(a,c) and p2(b,d)  to be two points on a 2D plane.

-- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
-- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
-- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
-- d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
Query the Manhattan Distance between points p1 and p2  and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.


Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

+-------------+----------+
| Field       | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| ID          | Number   |
| City        | Varchar2 |
| State       | Varchar2 |
| LAT_N       | Number   |
| LONG_W      | Number   |
+-------------+----------+
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.


**Solution**
```sql
Select round((max(lat_n)-min(lat_n) + max(long_w)- min(long_w)),4) as D from station
```
